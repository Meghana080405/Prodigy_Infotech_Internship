# 🏡 Task 1 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts house prices using a **Linear Regression** model trained on housing dataset features like:
- Living area (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)
- Bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Total rooms (`TotRmsAbvGrd`)

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`)
2. Loaded and explored the dataset (`train.csv`)
3. Selected key features and target variable (`SalePrice`)
4. Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio)
5. Standardized the features using `StandardScaler`
6. Trained a Linear Regression model
7. Evaluated model performance using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - R² Score
8. Visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices

---

## 📊 Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Mean Squared Error (MSE) | 2,804,232,273.58 |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | 35,891.67 |
| R² Score | 0.634 |
